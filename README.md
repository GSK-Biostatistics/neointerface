# Neointerface - Neo4j made easy for Python programmers!

A Python interface to use the Neo4j graph database, and simplify its use.

class **NeoInterface**:

    Class to interact programmatically with Neo4j using Python.
    It provides a higher-level wrapper around the Neo4j python connectivity library "Neo4j Python Driver" 
    (https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/current/api.html)
    
    This class reduces the need to know and use Cypher query language; 
    for a variety of common operations, class methods may be used instead of Cypher queries.
    Advanced users can pass Cypher directly.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: tested on **versions 4.3.6 and 4.4.11 of Neo4j**

# MICRO-TUTORIAL

## What are Neo4j/Graph Databases, and why do they matter?
If you're new, 
here's a [gentle brief intro](https://julianspolymathexplorations.blogspot.com/2021/02/neo4j-graph-databases-intro.html) 
by one of the authors of this class.

## In a nutshell
If you understand that:
1) Neo4j **nodes** are similar to *records* (rows) in relational databases or spreadsheets
2) Neo4j **node labels** vaguely correspond to table names (though a node can have multiple labels)
3) Neo4j **links (relationships)** are ways of pointing from a record to one or more others 
(akin to "foreign keys" or "join tables" in relational databases)
4) Neo4j includes a **query language named Cypher**, akin to SQL (but much more powerful!) 

then you're ready to start!

## How to set up Neo4j
For use within a company, consult on which method is preferred with your IT department.

*Any one of the following methods:*

* **Super-simple method for beginners**: get a [free account
at the Neo4j sandbox](https://neo4j.com/sandbox/); then use the credentials from that site
* Create or obtain a Docker container with Neo4j : see [appendix A](Appendixes.md)
* Install the free [Neo4j Community server](https://neo4j.com/download-center/#community) 
on your computer - Windows10 or Linux. You will 
also need [Java11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html), if 
don't have it already.
* Install the Windows program [Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download-center/#desktop)  (convenient, 
but be aware that you will be aggressively steered towards the Enterprise edition)
* Use a pre-made VM machine image that contains Neo4j, 
for example from the excellent [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/stack/neo4j)
* Use [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/), a managed solution

Note: some functions in this class, such as export_dbase_json(), require that the *APOC* library 
be installed alongside Neo4j - see [appendix B](Appendixes.md); the Docker option has APOC already enabled.
The RDF functionality requires both APOC and n10s installed.


## A quick gallop thru Neo4j
```python
import neointerface
db = neointerface.NeoInterface(host="neo4j://localhost:7687" , credentials=("neo4j", "YOUR_NEO4J_PASSWORD"))

# Create 2 new nodes (records).  The internal Neo4j node ID is returned
node1_id = db.create_node_by_label_and_dict("patient", {'patient_id': 123, 'gender': 'M'})
node2_id = db.create_node_by_label_and_dict("doctor", {'doctor_id': 1, 'name': 'Hippocrates'})

# You can think of the above as a 1-record table of patients and a 1-record table of doctors.
# Now link the patient to his doctor
db.link_nodes_by_ids(node1_id, node2_id, "IS_TREATED_BY", {'since': 2021})

# You can run general Cypher queries, or use existing methods that allow you to avoid
# them for common operations

# EXAMPLE: find all the patients of a doctor named 'Hippocrates'
cypher = "MATCH (p :patient)-[IS_TREATED_BY]->(d :doctor {name:'Hippocrates'}) RETURN p"
result = db.query(cypher)
print(result)   # SHOWS:  [{'p': {'gender': 'M', 'patient_id': 123}}]
```

## From Pandas dataframe to Neo4j and back
Let's say that you have a Pandas dataframe such as:
```python
import pandas as pd
df_original = pd.DataFrame({"patient_id": [100, 200], "name": ["Jack", "Jill"]})
```


(row number) | patient_id | name
-----| ---------| -------
0| 100 | Jack
1| 200 | Jill

Load it into the Neo4j database simply with:
```python
db.load_df(df_original, "my_label")
```

where *db* is the instantiated NeoInterface class from the earlier example.  The *"my_label"* string
roughly corresponds to table names in relational databases.
Voila', now you have 2 nodes in your database:
>**NODE 1**, with properties "patient_id"=100 and "name"="Jack"
> 
>**NODE 2**, with properties "patient_id"=200 and "name"="Jill"

If you want them back as a dataframe, just do:
```python
df_new = db.get_df("my_label")
```
## From dictionary to Neo4j
If you have a dictionary, for example:
```python
dictionary = {"class": "Dataset", "name": "DM", "Column": [{"name": "USUBJID"}, {"name": "DMDTC", "type": "datetime"}]}
```
Load it into the Neo4j database simply with:
```python
db.load_dict(dictionary, label="Dataset")
```
where *db* is the instantiated NeoInterface class from the earlier example, and label is the label to assign to the root node.

name | arguments| return
-----| ---------| -------
*NeoInterface*| host=os.environ.get("NEO4J_HOST"), credentials=(os.environ.get("NEO4J_USER"), os.environ.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD")), apoc=False, rdf=False, rdf_host = None, verbose=True, debug=False, autoconnect=True|

    If unable to create a Neo4j driver object, raise an Exception reminding the user to check whether the Neo4j database is running

    :param host:        URL to connect to database with.  DEFAULT: read from NEO4J_HOST environmental variable
    :param credentials: Pair of strings (tuple or list) containing, respectively, the database username and password
                        DEFAULT: read from NEO4J_USER and NEO4J_PASSWORD environmental variables

# Mini-UI
A mini user interface over some of the NeoInterface functionality is included in this repository. Simply set you environment variables to connect to Neo4j(NEO4J_HOST, NEO4J_USER and NEO4J_PASSWORD) and run 
```source app.sh```
on Unix.

# METHODS TO RUN GENERIC QUERIES



## query()
name | arguments| return
-----| ---------| -------
*query*| q: str, params = None, return_type = 'data'| list/neo4j.Result/pd.DataFrame/MultiDiGraph

        Runs a general Cypher query
        :param q:       A Cypher query
        :param params:  An optional Cypher dictionary
                        EXAMPLE, assuming that the cypher string contains the substrings "$node_id":
                                {'node_id': 20}
        :param return_type: type of the returned result 'data'/'neo4j.Result'/'pd'/'nx'
        *** When return_type == 'neo4j.Result':
        Returns result of the query as a raw neo4j.Result object
        (See https://neo4j.com/docs/api/python-driver/current/api.html#neo4j.Result)
        *** When return_type == 'data' (default):
        Returns a list of dictionaries.
        In cases of error, return an empty list.
        A new session to the database driver is started, and then immediately terminated after running the query.
        :return:        A (possibly empty) list of dictionaries.  Each dictionary in the list
                                will depend on the nature of the Cypher query.
                        EXAMPLES:
                            Cypher returns nodes (after finding or creating them): RETURN n1, n2
                                    -> list item such as {'n1': {'gender': 'M', 'patient_id': 123}
                                                          'n2': {'gender': 'F', 'patient_id': 444}}
                            Cypher returns attribute values that get renamed: RETURN n.gender AS client_gender, n.pid AS client_id
                                    -> list items such as {'client_gender': 'M', 'client_id': 123}
                            Cypher returns attribute values without renaming: RETURN n.gender, n.pid
                                    -> list items such as {'n.gender': 'M', 'n.pid': 123}
                            Cypher returns a single computed value
                                    -> a single list item such as {"count(n)": 100}
                            Cypher returns a single relationship, with or without attributes: MERGE (c)-[r:PAID_BY]->(p)
                                    -> a single list item such as [{ 'r': ({}, 'PAID_BY', {}) }]
                            Cypher creates nodes (without returning them)
                                    -> empty list
        *** When return_type == 'pd':
        Returns result of the query as a pandas dataframe
        (See https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
        by storing the values of node properties in columns of the dataframe
        (note the info about the labels of the nodes is not persisted)
        *** When return_type == 'nx':
        Returns result of the query as a networkx graph
        (See https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/multidigraph.html)

## query_expanded()
name | arguments| return
-----| ---------| -------
*query_expanded*| q: str, params = None, flatten = False| []

**NOTE: This procedure will be deprecated, use query(... return_type: str = 'neo4j.Result') instead**

    Expanded version of query(), meant to extract additional info for queries that return Graph Data Types,
    i.e. nodes, relationships or paths,
    such as "MATCH (n) RETURN n", or "MATCH (n1)-[r]->(n2) RETURN r"

    For example, if nodes were returned, and their Neo4j internal IDs and/or labels are desired
    (in addition to all the properties and their values)

    Unless the flatten flag is True, individual records are kept as separate lists.
        For example, "MATCH (b:boat), (c:car) RETURN b, c"
        will return a structure such as [ [b1, c1] , [b2, c2] ]  if flatten is False,
        vs.  [b1, c1, b2, c2]  if  flatten is True.  (Note: each b1, c1, etc, is a dictionary.)

    :param q:       A Cypher query
    :param params:  An optional Cypher dictionary
                        EXAMPLE, assuming that the cypher string contains the substring "$age":
                                    {'age': 20}
    :param flatten: Flag indicating whether the Graph Data Types need to remain clustered by record,
                    or all placed in a single flattened list.

    :return:        A (possibly empty) list of dictionaries, which will depend on which Graph Data Types
                                were returned in the Cypher query.
                                EXAMPLE - for a returned node
                                    {'gender': 'M', 'age': 20, 'neo4j_id': 123, 'neo4j_labels': ['patient']}
                                EXAMPLE - for a returned relationship
                                    {'price': 7500, 'neo4j_id': 2,
                                     'neo4j_start_node': <Node id=11 labels=frozenset() properties={}>,
                                     'neo4j_end_node': <Node id=14 labels=frozenset() properties={}>,
                                     'neo4j_type': 'bought_by'}]

# METHODS TO RETRIEVE DATA



## get_single_field()
name | arguments| return
-----| ---------| -------
*get_single_field*| labels, field_name: str, properties_condition=None, cypher_clause=None, cypher_dict=None| list

    For situations where one is fetching just 1 field,
    and one desires a list of those values, rather than a dictionary of records.
    In other respects, similar to the more general get_nodes()

    EXAMPLES: fetch_single_field("car", "price", properties_condition={"car_make": "Toyota"})
                    will RETURN a list of prices of all the Toyota models
              fetch_single_field("car", "price", properties_condition={"car_make": "Toyota"}, clause="n.price < 50000")
                    will RETURN a list of prices of all the Toyota models that cost less than 50000

    :param field_name:  A string with the name of the desired field (attribute)

    For more information on the other parameters, see get_nodes()

    :return:  A list of the values of the field_name attribute in the nodes that match the specified conditions

## get_nodes()
name | arguments| return
-----| ---------| -------
*get_nodes*| labels="", properties_condition=None, cypher_clause=None, cypher_dict=None, return_nodeid=False, return_labels=False| [{}]

    EXAMPLES:
        get_nodes("")       # Get ALL nodes
        get_nodes("client")
        get_nodes("client", properties_condition = {"gender": "M", "ethnicity": "white"})
        get_nodes("client", cypher_clause = "n.age > 40 OR n.income < 50000")
        get_nodes("client", cypher_clause = "n.age > $some_age", cypher_dict = {"$some_age": 40})
        get_nodes("client", properties_condition = {"gender": "M", "ethnicity": "white"} ,
                                       cypher_clause = "n.age > 40 OR n.income < 50000")
    RETURN a list of the records (as dictionaries of ALL the key/value node properties)
    corresponding to all the Neo4j nodes with the specified label,
        AND satisfying the given Cypher CLAUSE (if present),
        AND exactly matching ALL of the specified property key/values pairs  (if present).
        I.e. an implicit AND operation.
    IMPORTANT: nodes referred to in the Cypher clause must be specified as "n."

    A dictionary of data binding (cypher_dict) for the Cypher clause may be optionally specified.
    In case of conflict (any key overlap) between the dictionaries cypher_dict and properties_condition, and Exception is raised.
    Optionally, the Neo4j internal node ID and label name(s) may also be obtained and returned.

    :param labels:          A string (or list/tuple of strings) specifying one or more Neo4j labels;
                                an empty string indicates that the match is to be carried out
                                across all labels - NOT RECOMMENDED for large databases!
                                (Note: blank spaces ARE allowed in the strings)
    :param cypher_dict:     Dictionary of data binding for the Cypher string.  EXAMPLE: {"gender": "M", "age": 40}
    :param cypher_clause:   String with a clause to refine the search; any nodes it refers to, MUST be specified as "n."
                                EXAMPLE with hardwired values:  "n.age > 40 OR n.income < 50000"
                                EXAMPLE with data-binding:      "n.age > $age OR n.income < $income"
                                        (data-binding values are specified in cypher_dict)
    :param properties_condition: A (possibly-empty) dictionary of property key/values pairs. Example: {"gender": "M", age: 64}
                                 IMPORTANT: cypher_dict and properties_dict must have no overlapping keys, or an Exception will be raised
    :param return_nodeid:   Flag indicating whether to also include the Neo4j internal node ID in the returned data
                                (using "neo4j_id" as its key in the returned dictionary)
    :param return_labels:   Flag indicating whether to also include the Neo4j label names in the returned data
                                (using "neo4j_labels" as its key in the returned dictionary)
    :return:        A list whose entries are dictionaries with each record's information
                    (the node's attribute names are the keys)
                    EXAMPLE: [  {"gender": "M", "age": 42, "condition_id": 3},
                                {"gender": "M", "age": 76, "location": "Berkeley"}
                             ]
                    Note that ALL the attributes of each node are returned - and that they may vary across records.
                    If the flag return_nodeid is set to True, then an extra key/value pair is included in the dictionaries,
                            of the form     "neo4j_id": some integer with the Neo4j internal node ID
                    If the flag return_labels is set to True, then an extra key/value pair is included in the dictionaries,
                            of the form     "neo4j_labels": [list of Neo4j label(s) attached to that node]
                    EXAMPLE using both of the above flags:
                        [  {"neo4j_id": 145, "neo4j_labels": ["person", "client"], "gender": "M", "age": 42, "condition_id": 3},
                           {"neo4j_id": 222, "neo4j_labels": ["person"], "gender": "M", "age": 76, "location": "Berkeley"}
                        ]

                    The values are lists of dictionaries with 3 keys: "id", "label", "rel"
                        EXAMPLE of individual items in either parent_list or child_list:
                        {'id': 163, 'labels': ['Subject'], 'rel': 'HAS_TREATMENT'}

## get_indexes()
name | arguments| return
-----| ---------| -------
*get_indexes*| types=None| pd.DataFrame

    Return all the database indexes, and some of their attributes,
    as a Pandas dataframe.
    Optionally restrict the type (such as "BTREE") of indexes returned.

    EXAMPLE:
           labelsOrTypes            name          properties   type uniqueness
         0    [my_label]  index_23b0962b       [my_property]  BTREE  NONUNIQUE

*create_index*| label: str, key: str| bool

    Create a new database index, unless it already exists,
    to be applied to the specified label and key (property).
    The standard name given to the new index is of the form label.key

    EXAMPLE - to index nodes labeled "car" by their key "color":
                    create_index("car", "color")
              This new index - if not already in existence - will be named "car.color"

# UTILITY METHODS



## dict_to_cypher()
name | arguments| return
-----| ---------| -------
*dict_to_cypher*| data_dict: {}| (str, {})

    Turn a Python dictionary (meant for specifying node or relationship attributes)
    into a string suitable for Cypher queries,
    plus its corresponding data-binding dictionary.

    EXAMPLE :
                {'cost': 65.99, 'item description': 'the "red" button'}
            will lead to
                (
                    '{`cost`: $par_1, `item description`: $par_2}',
                    {'par_1': 65.99, 'par_2': 'the "red" button'}
                )

    Note that backticks are used in the Cypher string to allow blanks in the key names.
    Consecutively-named dummy variables ($par_1, $par_2, etc) are used,
    instead of names based on the keys of the data dictionary (such as $cost),
    because the keys might contain blanks.

    :param data_dict:   A Python dictionary
    :return:            A pair consisting of a string suitable for Cypher queries,
                            and a corresponding data-binding dictionary.
                        If the passed dictionary is empty or None,
                            the pair returned is ("", {})

               ]'
    }
    NOTE - the Neo4j Browser uses a slightly different format for NODES:
            {
              "identity": 4,
              "labels": [
                "User"

                "age": 18
              }
            }
          and a substantially more different format for RELATIONSHIPS:
            {
              "identity": 1,
              "start": 3,
              "end": 4,

                "since": 2003
              }
            }

    IMPORTANT - this function requires that the APOC library be installed alongside Neo4j
    
    :return:    A dictionary specifying the number of nodes exported,
                the number of relationships, and the number of properties,

-----| ---------| -------
*import_json_data*| json_str: str|

    Import nodes and/or relationships into the database, as directed by the given data dump in JSON form.
    Note: the id's of the nodes need to be shifted,
          because one cannot force the Neo4j internal id's to be any particular value...
          and, besides (if one is importing into an existing database), particular id's may already be taken.

    :param json_str:    A JSON string with the format specified under export_dbase_json()
    :return:            A status message with import details if successful, or an Exception if not
